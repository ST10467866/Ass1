# Project overview

The **Eazzy.Meals** is a mobile application developed as part of an assignment in the IMAD5111 subject. This application was created using **Kotlin** and **Android Studio**. The app's primary purpose is to Display meal options based on the time of day.

The app was developed to meet the requirements of the assignment, which includes creating a functional mobile app and utilizing GitHub for version control and CI/CD automation using GitHub Actions.
```
## Purpose and Features

### Purpose:
The main goal of this app is to [Provide a user with 3 meal options based on the time of day given by a user]. 

### Key Features:
- Feature 1: User login functionality
- Feature 2: Display 3 meal options per time of day
- Feature 3:Back button and Enter button
- Feature 4: First screen displays where the user will enter the time of day
- Feature 5: Second screen displays 3 meal choices based on the time of day inputed on the first screen

These features aim to provide The best meals suited for the user based on the time of day.


## Design Considerations:

The design of the **Eazzy.Meals** was based on the following key considerations:

1. **User Experience (UX)**: The app was designed with the goal of providing an intuitive and easy-to-navigate user interface, ensuring a seamless user experience.
   
2. **Responsiveness**: The app was built to ensure it performs well on different screen sizes, with particular attention to device compatibility.
   
3. **Simplicity**: The design is minimalistic, focusing on core features without overwhelming the user.
   
4. **Performance**: Code optimization was considered to ensure fast response times and low battery usage.
```

## GitHub and GitHub Actions

This project was managed using **GitHub** for version control, where all code changes were committed and pushed regularly. GitHub enabled collaborative coding, allowing me to keep track of changes and maintain project integrity.

### GitHub Actions:
I utilized **GitHub Actions** to automate the build and deployment process. This includes:

- Running automated **tests** to ensure the app’s functionality.
- Compiling the app into **APK** and **AAB** files, which are the formats required for distribution.
- Uploading these build artifacts to GitHub for easy access.

The workflow ensures that my project is automatically built and tested every time I push changes, and it simplifies the process of delivering the final APK/AAB files for submission.

## Challenges and Learnings

During the development of this project, I encountered several challenges, including:

1. **Challenge 1**: [Briefly describe a challenge you faced, e.g., "Implementing a complex feature like the login system."]
   - **Solution**: [How you solved the challenge, e.g., "I researched Firebase authentication and successfully integrated it into the app."]
   
2. **Challenge 2**: [Describe another challenge, e.g., "Debugging issues related to Gradle builds."]
   - **Solution**: [How you solved the challenge.]

From these challenges, I learned important lessons in debugging, using version control, and automating build processes with GitHub Actions.

## Future Enhancements

While the current version of the app provides the core functionality, there are several features that could be added in the future, including:

1. **Feature 1**: Ingredient list
2. **Feature 2**: Having a 3rd screen
3. **Feature 3**: A way to share the meal options with a friend
These enhancements would improve the app’s usability and make it even more versatile for end-users.
